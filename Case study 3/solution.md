   Case Study Questions
   --------------------*/
   
-------A. Customer Journey -------
--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
--write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- Customer-ID 1 started with a free trial subscription, then downgraded to a basic monthly subscription after the 7-day trial 

-- Customer-ID 2 started with a free trial subscription, then upgraded to a pro annual subscription after the 7-day trial 

-- Customer-ID 11 started with a free trial subscription, then cancelled their Foodie-Fi subscription after the 7-day trial 

-- Customer-ID 13 started with a free trial subscription, then downgraded to a basic monthly subscription after the 7-day trial. 3 months later, upgraded to a pro monthly subscription

-- Customer-ID 15 started with a free trial subscription, then automatically continued with the pro monthly subscription after the 7-day trial. A month later, they cancelled their Foodie-Fi subscription

-- Customer-ID 16 started with a free trial subscription, then downgraded to a basic monthly subscription after the 7-day trial. 4 months later, they upgraded to a pro annual subscription

-- Customer-ID 18 started with a free trial subscription and then automatically continued with the pro monthly subscription after the 7-day trial

-- Customer-ID 19 started with a free trial subscription and then automatically continued with the pro monthly subscription after the 7-day trial. 2 months later, they upgraded to the pro annual subscription.

-------D. Outside The Box Questions -------

--1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
--The current revenue subtracted by the previous revenue then divided by the previous revenue multiplied by 100 to get the percentage growth of the business.
--Values greater than 0 indicates a positive growth (profit) in business. Values less than 0 then indicate a negative growth (loss) in business. If the Value is 0 then their is no growth in the business (no profit or loss).
--Period over period(PoP) analysis is used to compare a measurement from one time period to that same measurement in a similar time period
--In this example we can do a month-over-month analysis or week-over-week analysis
--To calculate the revenue we would need to consider the change in plans, deductions, and cancellations.
--For this example I would calculate the monthly customer growth (outside the trial mode) instead of the revenue growth

WITH Monthly_customers AS (
                SELECT EXTRACT('Month' FROM start_date) AS Month,
                       TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') AS Months, 
                       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS Number_of_customers
                FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
                    INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans

                WHERE plan_name <> 'trial' 
                    AND plan_name <> 'churn'
                GROUP BY EXTRACT('Month' FROM start_date), TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month')
                ORDER BY EXTRACT('Month' FROM start_date)
)

SELECT Months, Number_of_customers, 
        LAG(Number_of_customers, 1) OVER(ORDER BY Month) AS Previous_number_of_customers,
        (100 * (Number_of_customers - LAG(Number_of_customers, 1) OVER(ORDER BY Month)) / LAG(Number_of_customers, 1) OVER(ORDER BY Month)) || '%' AS percentage_growth
FROM Monthly_customers

--2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
--Customer retention (after trial period)
--Sales Revenue
--Sales Growth Year-to-date
--Monthly churn rate
--Average customer lifetime
--Rate of new customers
--Ratio new customers to paying customers

--3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
--Finding out the rate of customer retention post trial period
--Finding out what is the most used plan after the trial and why
--Finding out what is the most downgraded plan and why
--Finding out what is the most upgraded plan and why
--Finding out the months or quarters that produce the most customers and why

--4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
--What prompted you to cancel your subscription
--What did you like the best and least about your subscription plan?
--Would you recommend this company to a friend? Why or why not?
--Did Foodie-Fi meet your expectations?  
--What suggestions do you have that the company can improve on?

--5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
--To reduce customer churn rate after trial period one could:
    --Improve trial service/on-boarding period as first impressions is key
    -- Implement a customer feedback loop to improve the business and get an understanding of the customers feelings
    -- Email marketing by sending company newsletter to remind customers about the service and improve company's reputation. This can be achieved through email automation
    -- Establishing loyalty programs where long-standing active customers(users) are given discount prices for products as a sign of appreciation 
-- This can be analysed using descriptive analytics such as summary statistics, clustering, and Cohort analysis
